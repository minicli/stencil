# Contributing to Minicli

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to Minicli! This document will give you some guidance on how to contribute and what we do expect from you as a contributor. Please notice these are guidelines, not rules, and you are always welcome to suggest changes to this document via a Pull Request.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways in which you can contribute. Here are some ideas:

- Reporting Issues / Bugs
- Suggesting Improvements
- Code 
  - bug fixes and new features that are within the main project scope
  - bug fixes and new features on the Minicli ecosystem ([application template](https://github.com/minicli/application), [curly](https://github.com/minicli/curly))
  - add-ons that can live in a separate package repository
  - CLI themes
  - improving test coverage
- Documentation (lives in the [website](https://github.com/minicli/website) repository)
  - corrections, new docs, improvements to the docs appearance
- Demos (lives in the [demos](https://github.com/minicli/demos) repository)

Apart from the main `minicli/minicli` package, the Minicli project has other repositories that you can contribute to. Most of the additional repositories are still experimental, working as add-ons to the main Minicli framework.

## Pull Request Process

Contributing requires you to create a pull request. Here's what we expect from you:

- Preferrably, discuss the changes beforehand by creating an issue. We don't want you to spend your time on something that might eventually not get accepted. It's better if we can talk about it before you dedicate your time.
- Be nice. We expect you to adhere to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times, whether if you're filing an issue, contributing code, or commenting on existing issues and pull requests.
- Provide enough information on the Pull Request's body - explain **why** and **how**.
- Code standards: we follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
- Make sure tests are passing. 

Here's what you can expect from us:

- Respectful and candid feedback ü§ù
- Help when you get stuck or need suggestions ü§≤
- We'll always try to accomodate your contribution, even if that means we'll make adjustments later üëç
- Gratitude!!! üôå
